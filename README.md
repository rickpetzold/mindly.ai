# Mindly - AI-Powered Thought Logging Platform

An intelligent thought logging platform that combines voice AI, multimodal input processing, and automated workflow management to capture and organize personal insights.

## Overview

Mindly is an intelligent thought logging platform that combines voice AI, multimodal input processing, and automated workflow management to capture and organize personal insights.

## Architecture

### Frontend

- **Softr-based web interface** with custom HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Multi-modal input support**: Voice recording, text input, image upload with captions
- **Real-time voice chat** integration with VAPI
- **Responsive design** optimized for mobile and desktop

### Backend (Vercel)

- **API Gateway** handling CORS, authentication, and data forwarding
- **Secure VAPI integration** with server-side assistant creation
- **Binary file handling** for audio and image processing
- **Environment-based routing** (test/production)

### Automation (n8n)

- **Real-time workflow processing** triggered by webhooks
- **Airtable integration** for data persistence and retrieval
- **AI-powered content analysis** and categorization
- **Dynamic user context** management and personalization

### Voice AI (VAPI)

- **Personalized assistants** created per user with custom prompts
- **Real-time function calling** for data capture during conversations
- **Secure webhook routing** through backend proxy
- **Tool-based information storage** with intent recognition
